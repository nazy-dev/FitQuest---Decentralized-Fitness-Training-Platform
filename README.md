# FitQuest - Decentralized Fitness Training Platform

## Overview

FitQuest is a blockchain-based fitness tracking and community engagement platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform enables athletes to create workout routines, log training sessions, share feedback, and earn FPT (FitQuest Power Tokens) for their fitness achievements.

## Features

### üèãÔ∏è Core Functionality

## Error Codes

| Code | Constant | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| u100 | `err-deployer-only` | Action restricted to contract deployer |
| u101 | `err-record-not-found` | Requested record does not exist |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts
- Stacks wallet for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fitquest
```

2. Install Clarinet (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/latest/download/clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz
```

3. Check the contract:
```bash
clarinet check
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

1. Configure your deployment settings in `Clarinet.toml`

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

3. Deploy to mainnet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --mainnet
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Your First Workout Routine

```clarity
(contract-call? .fitquest create-workout-routine
  "HIIT Cardio"
  "intense"
  "cardio"
  "Jump rope"
  u30
  u150)
```

### Logging a Training Session

```clarity
(contract-call? .fitquest record-training-session
  u1  ;; routine-index
  "Morning HIIT"
  u10  ;; warm-up-mins
  u155  ;; target-heart-rate
  u3  ;; reps-completed
  u4  ;; effort-rating
  u4  ;; form-quality
  "Great session, felt strong!"
  true)  ;; goal-achieved
```

### Submitting Feedback

```clarity
(contract-call? .fitquest submit-feedback
  u1  ;; routine-index
  u9  ;; score
  "Excellent routine! Really challenging."
  "great")
```

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated for length and range
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Mechanisms prevent duplicate feedback and achievement claims
- **Access Control**: Users cannot manipulate others' data or kudos their own feedback
- **Token Supply**: Hard cap on token supply prevents inflation
- **No Token Transfer**: Tokens are non-transferable (mint-only design)

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Implement workout routine categories and filtering
- [ ] Add social features (following, workout buddies)
- [ ] Create leaderboards for various metrics
- [ ] Implement workout streak tracking
- [ ] Add nutrition tracking integration
- [ ] Build mobile-friendly frontend interface
- [ ] Integrate with fitness wearables
- [ ] Add NFT badges for achievements
